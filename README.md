# Weather App

This is a fully-funcitoning weather app made with javascript, React, html, and css. In this app, you are able to type in a city and live weather is displayed. As the weather conditions change, the background asccoiated with the weather changes. I made Axios request from openweathermap.org. Rememeber once this project is cloned to run "npm install" in the terminal and then "npm start".
